# Lemma Finance

Lemma is a DeFi (Decentralized Finance) product that allows cryptocurrency holders to generate yield on their ETH (and soon USDC) via basis trading.
LUSDC is the Lemma yield bearing version of USDC.
LUSDC represents your underlying principle (the current USDC value of the ETH deposited) plus yield Lemma has generated by basis trading deposited assets.

The price of LUSDC is dictated by the following equation: P = m / n

where:
 P is the price of LUSDC.
 n is the number of LUSDC in circulation.
 m is the amount of USDC Lemma has.
